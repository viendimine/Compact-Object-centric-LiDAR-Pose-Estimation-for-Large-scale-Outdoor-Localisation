# Compact Object centric LiDAR Pose-Estimation for Large scale Outdoor Localisation
## Problem:-
Modern LiDAR sensors, which are commonly used in autonomous vehicles for perceiving the surrounding environment, can generate massive amounts of data. A single LiDAR scan can capture tens of thousands of points, where each point represents a precise 3D location in space. This high-resolution 3D point cloud data is crucial for accurate perception and mapping but comes at the cost of substantial storage requirements.
In the domain of autonomous driving, these storage requirements become even more pronounced. Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed 3D maps of the environment for localization, path planning, and navigation. These maps need to cover vast areas, potentially spanning entire cities or regions, to enable autonomous driving capabilities. As a result, the storage demands for these large-scale 3D maps can be substantial, requiring significant memory resources.
